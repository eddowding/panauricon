[00:00:02] if she borrows too much or they lose confidence in her.
[00:00:05] What is that?
[00:00:06] I I want to understand your view because it almost seem to be you were saying well we can borrow from the Bank of England, they can print the money if we if we need it.
[00:00:14] I'm absolutely not saying that and I've never said that we can borrow without constraint.
[00:00:18] And it's sometimes been misinterpreted as that.
[00:00:20] And it's important to uh correct it.
[00:00:23] I think a really important thing here is money is inherently political.
[00:00:27] So, when you have people who have opinions on economics or you have the IFS for instance, Paul Johnson, the former director of the IFS compared me today to Nigel Farage.
[00:00:38] Well, look, I despise Nigel Farage's politics.
[00:00:42] We couldn't be more different.
[00:00:44] So, to have someone who is supposedly an independent economist for 10, 15 years of the IFS now weighing in like that politically.
[00:00:52] I think that's something of a facade.
[00:00:54] Well, he was saying he was saying simple solutions and and which which don't bear scrutiny.
[00:00:59] So, I I I guess I mean the problem is you want to spend a lot more money, you want government to spend a lot more money and and you don't want to tax ordinary people.
[00:01:10] There's some skepticism you'll get it all from your wealth taxes and and and billionaire taxes.
[00:01:17] And and you've tried to be relaxed about borrowing more.
[00:01:21] And I I I guess you've been clarifying here you're not relaxed about borrowing.
[00:01:25] You accept the bond markets have to be on side.
[00:01:28] There's two things here.
[00:01:29] One, we will not get everything from a wealth tax.
[00:01:31] And again I've never said that.
[00:01:32] We should be bringing capital gains tax in line with income tax.
[00:01:36] Right now we tax earned income more than we tax unearned wealth.
[00:01:41] Now Rachel Reeves has tinkered again but we still I believe have the lowest capital gains in the G7.
[00:01:48] So I think there's some obvious things that that need to happen there.
[00:01:51] Again, to your question though, I think it's about borrowing to invest, also putting that frame.
[00:01:57] We know there's something called spending multiplier.
[00:02:00] So for instance, every pound that is spent in the economy on the environment or the climate crisis, you get 1.88 back.
[00:02:08] Now, today I was at the national emergency briefing.
[00:02:12] This is with scientists, uh with Chris Packham, lots of people who are ultimately saying that in that budget, the climate crisis and the nature crisis weren't mentioned once.
[00:02:23] So, to directly answer your question, it's not that we should ignore the bond markets, it's not that we should ignore the markets, of course we shouldn't.
[00:02:31] But why are we buying the market to be center stage all the time as opposed to the things that we actually need to do, investing in climate adaptation, make sure we're building homes that are uh affordable and also insulating our homes.
[00:02:46] To have a government cutting insulation at the same time that we have a cost of living crisis so bills are going up and the climate crisis is morally and um is totally incoherent.
[00:02:57] Borrow to invest.
[00:02:58] Actually get that.
[00:03:00] clear on.
[00:03:00] Now you'll know you actually got you got a name check in the budget yesterday, Zach.
[00:03:06] The Chancellor mentioned you in the budget.
[00:03:10] Um I don't know how worried they are about you that she chose to do that, but she was mocking you.
