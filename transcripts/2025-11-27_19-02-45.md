[00:08] integrated and their cohesive.
[00:11] I think these are the things that I want to grow.
[00:13] In terms of talking about economic growth, I think the woman during the Brexit campaign put that best when she said, who's GDP?
[00:19] This is your GDP.
[00:21] I don't think that matters to people.
[00:22] I think what matters to people is their wages aren't going up.
[00:25] GDP.
[00:26] I mean, come on, that is GDP, isn't it?
[00:28] Um, well, not necessarily.
[00:30] wages going up counts as extra GDP.
[00:33] That's to say I only want my wages to go up.
[00:35] I don't want GDP.
[00:36] You know that than they seven because GDP has been fine in the past yet, living standards have still been squeezed.
[00:42] It's not a good measure of people's living standards and also that's what we're looking at.
[00:46] It's not a I'd say it's almost the opposite of a perfect measure.
[00:50] I think it's a pretty awful measure and most importantly, it's clearly destroying our environment, destroying nature because it's all done on the sacrificial lamb GDP, as opposed to actually caring about the things we should care about, which is compassion towards our neighbors, nature and the ecological crisis.
[01:11] migration.
[01:16] politics feels like moving for or against migration and asylum.
[01:22] Um, do you?
[01:25] And net migration has fallen very dramatically in the last the last year.
[01:29] I think it's pretty worrying actually because we have 150,000 vacancies in the National Health Service.
[01:34] We have a declining birth rate and we also know that we have an issue with pensions if we want to talk about the welfare bill.
[01:40] We know that pensions is the biggest part of that and it really gets mentioned.
[01:44] And so this isn't about necessarily being pro migration or anti migration.
[01:49] It's about being pro humanity though and we were talking about small boats.
[01:53] If people are fleeing war and persecution, to have a labor Home Secretary basically handing the country on a plate to Nigel Farage, because when he says jump, this labor government says how high, is pretty vile.
[02:05] And so I am proud to sit here as the leader of the Green party with an immigration system says we want humanity and compassion.
[02:11] We want to migration system.
[02:15] The migration is sick.
[02:18] And when this really started to get bad in terms of the small boats was in 2016 when the conservative government deliberately shut down process offenses so it would create a backlog.
[02:29] Now people often say, but they're not working.
[02:32] That's because they're not allowed to work.
